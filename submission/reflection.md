# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?
For this project, I mainly used ChatGPT to help me understand how to build my weather app step by step. It guided me in learning how APIs work, how to fetch weather data in JSON format, and how to visualize it using Python libraries like matplotlib. Whenever I got stuck, I asked ChatGPT for examples or explanations in simple terms, and that really helped me understand each concept better instead of just copying code.

## Prompting Techniques
Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?
I used a mix of detailed and follow-up prompts while working on the project. I started with broad questions like “How can I make a weather app in Python?” and then slowly narrowed them down to specific topics such as regular expressions, API usage, and graph plotting. I also tried re-asking questions in different ways to compare answers and get clearer explanations. This helped me learn how to ask better, more focused questions to get exactly what I needed.

## What Worked Well?
Describe one thing you’re proud of.
I’m proud that I managed to connect everything together — from fetching real weather data online to turning it into clear graphs. I didn’t just make something that runs; I actually understood how it works. Seeing my code display real weather information for different cities felt rewarding, and it showed me how programming and data analysis can come together in a practical way.

## What Would You Do Differently?
Describe one thing you'd change if you had more time.
If I had more time, I’d make the app more interactive, maybe by adding a simple interface where users can type a city name and instantly see its temperature and rainfall chart. I’d also like to add more weather details like humidity, wind speed, or a weekly forecast to make it feel more complete and user-friendly.

## Final Thoughts
Any parting comments on your learning experience?
Overall, this project was a great learning experience. I learned how to use APIs, process data in Python, and present it visually. More importantly, I realized how helpful AI tools can be when used correctly — not to replace thinking, but to support it. It made coding less intimidating and more enjoyable, and I feel much more confident now in creating similar projects in the future.
